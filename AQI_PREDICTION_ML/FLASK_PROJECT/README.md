# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction & Forecasting – Flask Web Application

This repository contains a **Flask-based Machine Learning web application** developed to predict and forecast **Air Quality Index (AQI)** values using pollutant data and time‑series lag features.  
The project is built as a **portfolio‑ready ML deployment**, integrating trained models (`.pkl`) with a clean web interface.

---

## Project Overview

The application is divided into **two core functionalities**:

### 1️⃣ Pollutant‑Based AQI Prediction (Current AQI)
Predicts the **current AQI value** using pollutant concentrations such as:
- PM2.5  
- PM10  
- NO₂  
- SO₂  
- CO  
- O₃  
- NH₃  

A trained **Random Forest regression model** is used to estimate AQI based on historical CPCB-style data.

---

### 2️⃣ Next‑Hour AQI Forecasting
Forecasts the **AQI for the next hour** using:
- Lag‑based AQI features
- Engineered time‑series inputs

This converts the forecasting problem into a **supervised learning task**, allowing the model to learn short‑term AQI trends.

- pip
- Git (optional)

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
cd FlaskWebProject1
```

---

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

**Windows**
```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Step 4: Run the Flask App
```bash
python runserver.py
```

You should see output similar to:

## AQI Category Mapping (CPCB Standard)

| AQI Range | Category |
|----------|----------|
| 0 – 50   | Good |
| 51 – 100 | Satisfactory |
| 101 – 200 | Moderate |
| 201 – 300 | Poor |
| 301 – 400 | Very Poor |
| 401 – 500 | Severe |

## Models & Artifacts

- **AQI_RandomForest_Model.pkl**  
  Pollutant → AQI regression model

- **aqi_next_hour_forecast_model.pkl**  
  Time‑series based AQI forecasting model

- **Feature `.pkl` files**  
  Ensure correct feature ordering during inference

> ⚠️ Feature order must exactly match training to avoid incorrect predictions.

---

## Evaluation & Learning Outcomes

- Regression metrics: MAE, RMSE, R²
- Time‑series forecasting using lag features
- Real‑world AQI modeling constraints
- Model persistence and deployment using Flask
- End‑to‑end ML pipeline: data → model → web app

---

## Limitations

- Forecasting limited to short‑term (next hour)
- Depends on historical data quality
- Station‑specific trends may vary
- Not a replacement for official CPCB AQI reporting

---

## Future Improvements

- Multi‑hour / daily AQI forecasting
- REST API endpoints (JSON-based)
- Interactive charts & visualisations
- Cloud deployment (Render / Railway)
- Docker containerisation
