# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction & Forecasting  
**Machine Learning Project (with Flask Deployment Demo)**

This repository contains a **complete end‑to‑end machine learning project** focused on understanding, modelling, and predicting **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using real-world air pollution data.  
The core contribution of this work lies in **data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and short‑term forecasting**. A Flask application is included only to **demonstrate deployment** of the trained models.

## Project Overview

Air Quality Index (AQI) is a composite indicator influenced by multiple pollutants and temporal patterns.  
This project addresses AQI prediction through **two clearly separated but related ML problems**:

### **Part A — AQI Estimation (Same‑Hour Prediction)**
> *Given pollutant concentrations at a particular hour, estimate the AQI for that same hour.*

### **Part B — AQI Forecasting (Next‑Hour Prediction)**
> *Given recent AQI behaviour, forecast the AQI for the next hour.*

This separation allows the project to demonstrate both **static regression modelling** and **time‑dependent forecasting using supervised learning**.

---

## Why the Project Is Divided into Two Parts

| Aspect | Part A | Part B |
|-----|------|------|
| Problem Type | Regression | Time‑series forecasting (supervised) |
| Input | Pollutant values | Lag‑based AQI features |
| Output | Current AQI | Next‑hour AQI |
| Learning Focus | Pollutant‑AQI relationship | Temporal AQI behaviour |

This structure mirrors real‑world AQI systems where **estimation and forecasting are distinct tasks**.

## Dataset Description

- **Source:** Cleaned CPCB‑style air quality dataset  
- **Location:** Delhi monitoring stations  
- **Granularity:** Hourly observations  

### Key Feature Groups
- **Time Features:** Date, hour, day, month
- **Pollutants:** PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃, NH₃
- **Meteorological Parameters:** Temperature, humidity, wind speed (where available)
- **Station Metadata:** Station ID and location info
- **Derived Columns:** AQI sub‑indices and categorical labels

The notebook includes **explicit column‑by‑column explanations** and justification for feature selection.

## Part A — AQI Estimation (Same‑Hour AQI)

### Problem Formulation
- **Type:** Supervised regression
- **Target:** AQI numeric value
- **Inputs:** Pollutant concentrations and selected environmental features

### Data Processing
- Missing value handling
- Removal of non‑predictive identifiers
- Feature correlation analysis
- Target isolation and feature selection

### Model Used
- **Random Forest Regressor**

**Why Random Forest?**
- Captures non‑linear pollutant interactions
- Robust to noise and outliers
- Strong performance on tabular environmental data
- Minimal distributional assumptions

### Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## Part B — AQI Forecasting (Next‑Hour Prediction)

### Forecasting Approach

Instead of classical time‑series models (ARIMA), forecasting is reframed as a **supervised ML problem** using **lag features**.

### Lag Feature Engineering
Examples:
- AQI at time *t*
- AQI at *t−1*, *t−2*
- Optional pollutant lag values

This allows the model to learn **short‑term AQI momentum and trends**.

### Model Characteristics
- Predicts AQI at *t + 1 hour*
- Trained with time‑aware data splitting
- Suitable for real‑time inference pipelines

### Forecasting Scope
- Short‑term only (next hour)
- Designed for interpretability and deployment readiness

## AQI Categorisation

Predicted AQI values are optionally mapped to **CPCB standard categories**:

| AQI Range | Category |
|------|------|
| 0–50 | Good |
| 51–100 | Satisfactory |
| 101–200 | Moderate |
| 201–300 | Poor |
| 301–400 | Very Poor |
| 401–500 | Severe |

## Model Artefacts

Saved for reproducibility and deployment:

- `AQI_RandomForest_Model.pkl` — Pollutant‑based AQI model  
- `aqi_next_hour_forecast_model.pkl` — Forecasting model  
- `aqi_pollutant_features.pkl` — Feature order (Part A)  
- `aqi_forecast_features.pkl` — Feature order (Part B)

> **Feature order consistency is critical** to avoid incorrect predictions.

## Key Learnings from This Project

- AQI estimation and AQI forecasting are **fundamentally different ML problems**
- Lag‑based supervised ML works well for short‑horizon forecasting
- Environmental data is noisy and non‑linear
- ML complements but does not replace official AQI calculation frameworks
- Deployment readiness requires strict feature consistency

---

## Limitations

- Forecasting limited to next‑hour horizon
- Station‑specific effects are simplified
- No live sensor ingestion
- Not a substitute for official CPCB AQI computation

---

## Flask Deployment (Secondary Component)

A **Flask web application** is provided separately to:
- Load trained models
- Accept user inputs
- Display predictions via a simple UI

> The Flask layer exists **only to demonstrate deployment**.  
> A separate README inside the Flask folder explains how to run it.

## Flask deployment details are documented here:
FlaskWebProject1/README.md
